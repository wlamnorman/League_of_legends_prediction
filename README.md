# League_of_legends_prediction

This project focuses on model development, not necessarily on finding a perfect model, but on the workflow and evaluation of models. We consider how optimizing a classification model for accuracy does not necessarily mean that it's corresponding predicted probabilities are good estimates. Continuing the thread, we look at how we may predict probabilities instead by comparing predicited probabilities against the true classification.
